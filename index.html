          <small>The conservation message of this book, published in 1972, is ahead of its time. Humans look at a
            distant star and think it looks a lot more attractive than Earth, so sets out to reach it. But why is the
            Earth unattractive? Because humans have spoilt it. Built over and rubbish-strewn, it is a mess. But the
            dinosaurs awaken and begin to tidy up. Humans can only return if they promise to share the Earth in future.
            Brilliant illustrations convey an important message without preaching.</small>

          <small>"Henry was horrid. Everyone said so. Even his mother." So arrives Horrid Henry, one of the most
            successful antiheroes in kids' fiction. Henry snatches, pushes, shoves and pinches. But these acts are
            nothing compared with how horrid Henry is to his brother, Perfect Peter. In the four stories in this volume,
            Henry does anything to get what he wants. With an unerring ability to capture the cruellest details of
            sibling rivalry, these stories are driven by an infectious humour that tempers the tension.</small>

          <small>Nasty and disgusting antiheroes of a Dahlesque kind are in vogue; their filthy habits and displeasing
            behaviour makes them both childlike and a delightful source of easy humour. Mr Gum is just such a character:
            he hates children, animals, fun and every cartoon that has ever been made. But he loves money and will do
            anything to get his hands on some. Can anyone stop him? Read and find out.</small>

            determined to get Mr Fox as he is to outwit them. And though he may be a thief, he is no villain. Rather,
            he's a hero and readers love him for it.</small>

          <small>In this children's masterpiece, David McKee has created a miniature morality tale. The General leads
            his army into one country after another, subjugating the population and bringing them under his command.
            Finally, there is just one tiny country left to invade and the General leads his men forth. But here there
            is no conquest. Instead, the soldiers join the people and soon two countries are co-existing rather than
            fighting. Beautifully understated but packs a punch.</small>

          <small>This was the book that, more than any other of its time, changed the way the western world thought, and
            talked, about sex. It follows a young female erotic poet called Isadora Wing who, bored with her second
            marriage, ditches her husband at a psychoanalysts' conference in Vienna to travel through Europe in search
            of herself, and great sex (so long as the latter comes with no strings). The only thing holding her back: a
            crippling fear of flying.</small>

            and Florence, 22 and 23, are on honeymoon, about to lose their virginities. Only, each has a vastly
            different view on how it should go down.</small>
